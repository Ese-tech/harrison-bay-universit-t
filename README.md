# UIB - basic - Project
My Project is a University website.

## Basics
Header, Main and footer elements are some of the most basic features you will find on the website.
I created 4 `index.html` files and a CSS stylesheets
that are connected with <a href> and JS for nav.
In my html i added classes, `form action` to create a form on a web page that can collect user input and submit it to a server for processing the URL where the form data should be sent when the form is submitted,`button type`to create a clickable button on a web page Submits the form it is associated with.
onclick="clickliste(event)", the clickliste function is called when the element is clicked, and the event object is passed to it and it is JavaScript Functions: You can define any JavaScript function and call it in response to user interactions.The <input> element is used to create various types of interactive fields that allow users to enter data. The type attribute defines what kind of input is expected.
Divs with IDs and class for the img Gallery, Links and icon links.
