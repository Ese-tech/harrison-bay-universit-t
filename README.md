# UIB - basic - Project
My Project is a University website.

## Basics
Header, Main and footer elements are some of the most basic features you will find on the website.
I created 4 `index.html` files and a CSS stylesheets
that are connected with <a href> and JS for nav

## Content Styling 
- font-family from googelfronts
- Fixed background-image with full coverage
- paddings, margins, border
- webkit-box-shadow and box-shadow to apply shadow effects to elements
